name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write minimal, strategic tests focusing on core user flows and critical paths, testing behavior rather than implementation, with clear test names, mocked external dependencies, and fast execution. Use this skill when writing unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, test files, test cases, or test suites for any code. This includes working with testing frameworks (Jest, Vitest, Mocha, RSpec, pytest, JUnit), testing libraries (React Testing Library, Vue Test Utils), mocking frameworks, or test runners. Apply when writing tests for completed features at logical completion points, testing core user workflows and critical paths, writing descriptive test names that explain behavior and expected outcomes, mocking external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems), ensuring fast test execution for frequent developer runs, testing behavior rather than implementation details, or deciding which areas require test coverage. Note: Write minimal tests during development, defer edge case testing unless business-critical, focus on primary workflows over utilities.

# Testing Test Writing

## When to use this skill

- When writing unit tests for functions, methods, or classes
- When writing integration tests for modules or services
- When writing end-to-end tests for user workflows
- When creating test files or test suites (*.test.js, *_spec.rb, test_*.py)
- When testing completed features at logical completion points
- When testing core user flows and critical business paths
- When writing descriptive test names that explain behavior and expectations
- When mocking external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems, network calls)
- When ensuring tests execute quickly (milliseconds for unit tests)
- When testing behavior (what code does) rather than implementation (how it does it)
- When working with testing frameworks (Jest, Vitest, Mocha, RSpec, pytest, JUnit)
- When using testing libraries (React Testing Library, Vue Test Utils, Enzyme)
- When deciding what requires test coverage vs what can be deferred
- When avoiding excessive tests for non-critical utilities or edge cases
- When refactoring tests to reduce brittleness

This skill applies to all test writing regardless of language or testing framework.

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle testing test writing.
