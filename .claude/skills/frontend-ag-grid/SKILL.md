name: Frontend Ag Grid
description: Implement AG Grid data tables with proper TypeScript integration, column definitions, performance optimization, and React component patterns. Use this skill when creating or modifying AG Grid components, data grids, table components with AG Grid React, column definition configurations, value getters and formatters, cell renderers, grid APIs, export functionality, or any code involving AG Grid library. This includes working with AgGridReact components, ColDef and ColGroupDef types, GridApi interfaces, module registration, grid theming, hierarchical column groups, cell styling, data formatting, or grid lifecycle management. Apply when building programmatic column definitions, implementing custom value getters and formatters, managing grid state with refs and effects, optimizing grid performance, handling row data with stable IDs, implementing CSV/Excel export, creating cell class functions for styling, using signal-based reactivity patterns, or integrating AG Grid with React/TypeScript applications.

# Frontend Ag Grid

## When to use this skill

- When creating or modifying AG Grid React components
- When building data tables or grid interfaces using AG Grid
- When defining column configurations (ColDef, ColGroupDef)
- When implementing custom value getters or value formatters
- When creating cell renderers or cell class functions
- When working with the GridApi or grid refs
- When registering AG Grid modules (AllCommunityModule, ModuleRegistry)
- When implementing grid theming (ag-theme-alpine, ag-theme-material)
- When building hierarchical column groups or nested headers
- When implementing dynamic cell styling based on data
- When managing grid state with useRef and useState
- When optimizing grid performance (memoization, stable row IDs)
- When implementing CSV or Excel export functionality
- When handling grid lifecycle with useEffect
- When integrating AG Grid with TypeScript (typing row data, columns, APIs)
- When using signal-based reactivity for grid data updates
- When implementing pagination, sorting, or filtering
- When setting up defaultColDef for consistent column behavior
- When troubleshooting AG Grid rendering or performance issues
