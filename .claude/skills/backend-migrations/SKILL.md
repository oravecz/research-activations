name: Backend Migrations
description: Create and manage database migrations following best practices for reversibility, zero-downtime deployments, and safe schema evolution. Use this skill when creating database migration files, writing schema changes, implementing rollback methods, modifying table structures, adding or removing columns, creating or dropping indexes, altering constraints, or performing data migrations. This includes working with migration frameworks like Alembic, Flyway, Liquibase, Rails migrations, Django migrations, Sequelize migrations, TypeORM migrations, or similar database versioning tools. Apply when designing backwards-compatible schema changes, separating schema and data migrations, managing index creation on large tables, implementing zero-downtime deployment strategies, or writing reversible migration operations.

- When altering database constraints (foreign keys, unique constraints, check constraints)
- When performing data migrations or transformations
- When working with migration frameworks like Alembic, Flyway, Liquibase, Rails migrations, Django migrations, Sequelize migrations, or TypeORM migrations
- When designing backwards-compatible schema changes for zero-downtime deployments
- When separating schema migrations from data migrations

- When reviewing or refactoring existing migration files

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend migrations.
