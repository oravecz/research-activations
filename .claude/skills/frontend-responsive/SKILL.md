name: Frontend Responsive
description: Implement responsive designs using mobile-first development, standard breakpoints, fluid layouts, and relative units to ensure optimal viewing experiences across all device sizes. Use this skill when creating or modifying responsive layouts, media queries, breakpoint logic, mobile navigation patterns, adaptive UI components, or any code that needs to adapt to different screen sizes. This includes working with CSS media queries, Tailwind responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:), flexbox/grid layouts, viewport units, responsive images, mobile-first CSS, touch-friendly interfaces, or device-specific styling. Apply when implementing mobile layouts that scale up to desktop, defining consistent breakpoints across the application, using fluid percentage-based widths, preferring rem/em over fixed pixels, optimizing for touch targets (minimum 44x44px), ensuring readable typography at all sizes, prioritizing content on smaller screens, or testing layouts across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.
