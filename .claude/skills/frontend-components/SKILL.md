name: Frontend Components
description: Build reusable, composable UI components with single responsibility, clear interfaces, proper encapsulation, and local state management. Use this skill when creating or modifying React components, Vue components, Angular components, Svelte components, web components, or any frontend UI component files. This includes working with functional components, class components, custom hooks, component props and interfaces, component composition patterns, higher-order components, render props, component lifecycle methods, or component state management. Apply when designing component APIs with clear prop interfaces, building reusable components for design systems, implementing component composition, managing component state locally, documenting component usage and examples, refactoring monolithic components into smaller pieces, creating component libraries, or ensuring components follow single responsibility principle.

# Frontend Components

## When to use this skill

- When creating or modifying React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, or web components
- When designing component APIs and prop interfaces
- When building reusable components for design systems or component libraries
- When implementing component composition patterns
- When managing component state (useState, local state, component data)
- When writing component documentation or usage examples
- When refactoring large components into smaller, focused pieces
- When ensuring components follow single responsibility principle
- When creating custom hooks or composables for shared logic
- When implementing higher-order components or render props
- When working with component lifecycle methods or effects
- When defining TypeScript interfaces for component props
- When building complex UIs from simpler component primitives
- When keeping component implementation details encapsulated
- When lifting state up from child to parent components
- When minimizing component props for better maintainability
- When naming components clearly and consistently

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle frontend components.
