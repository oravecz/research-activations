name: Backend Models
description: Define and structure database models with clear naming, proper data types, constraints, relationships, and validation following ORM best practices. Use this skill when creating or modifying model definitions, database schemas, ORM classes, entity definitions, table structures, or data model files. This includes working with SQLAlchemy models, Django models, Sequelize models, TypeORM entities, ActiveRecord models, Prisma schemas, Mongoose schemas, or similar ORM/ODM frameworks. Apply when defining model fields and data types, setting up relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many, one-to-one), implementing model-level validation, adding database constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, foreign keys), creating indexes on frequently queried fields, adding timestamps for auditing, or designing normalized database schemas.

# Backend Models

## When to use this skill

- When creating or modifying model definition files
- When defining database schemas or table structures
- When working with ORM classes or entity definitions
- When setting up model fields and choosing appropriate data types
- When defining relationships between models (one-to-many, many-to-many, one-to-one)
- When implementing model-level validation logic
- When adding database constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, foreign keys, check constraints)
- When creating indexes on foreign keys or frequently queried fields
- When adding created_at and updated_at timestamps for auditing
- When designing normalized database schemas
- When working with SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, Sequelize, TypeORM, ActiveRecord, Prisma, Mongoose, or similar frameworks
- When defining cascade behaviors for relationships
- When refactoring model structures for better data integrity or performance

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend models.
