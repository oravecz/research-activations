name: Global Validation
description: Implement comprehensive validation including mandatory server-side validation, optional client-side validation for UX, early input validation, specific error messages, allowlist-based rules, type and format checking, input sanitization, and business rule validation. Use this skill when validating user input, form data, API request payloads, function parameters, database inputs, or any data that crosses trust boundaries. This includes working with validation libraries (Joi, Yup, Zod, validator.js), form validation frameworks, server-side validators, input sanitization functions, or custom validation logic. Apply when implementing server-side validation for security and data integrity, adding client-side validation for immediate user feedback, validating data types, formats, ranges, and required fields, providing field-specific error messages, using allowlists instead of blocklists, sanitizing input to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command injection), validating business rules (sufficient balance, valid date ranges), or ensuring consistent validation across all entry points (web forms, API endpoints, background jobs).

# Global Validation

## When to use this skill

- When validating user input from forms or interactive elements
- When validating API request payloads or parameters
- When implementing server-side validation (required for security)
- When adding client-side validation for better user experience
- When validating function parameters or method arguments
- When checking data before database insertion or updates
- When validating data types, formats, ranges, or required fields
- When providing specific, field-level error messages to users
- When using allowlists to define valid input rather than blocklists
- When sanitizing user input to prevent injection attacks
- When validating business rules (balance checks, date constraints, permissions)
- When ensuring consistent validation across multiple entry points
- When working with validation libraries (Joi, Yup, Zod, validator.js)
- When implementing fail-fast validation strategies
- When reviewing code for validation coverage and security

This skill applies universally across frontend, backend, and API validation scenarios.

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global validation.
