name: Global Coding Style
description: Write clean, consistent code following established naming conventions, automated formatting rules, meaningful variable names, small focused functions, and DRY principles across all languages and file types. Use this skill when writing or refactoring any code in any language (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, Ruby, etc.), including source files, scripts, configuration files, or any programming context. Apply when choosing variable, function, class, or file names, formatting code with consistent indentation and line breaks, keeping functions small and single-purpose, removing dead code and unused imports, extracting common logic into reusable functions, avoiding code duplication (DRY principle), or ensuring backward compatibility only when explicitly required. This skill applies universally across frontend, backend, database, scripting, and infrastructure code.

# Global Coding Style

## When to use this skill

- When writing or refactoring code in any programming language
- When choosing names for variables, functions, classes, interfaces, or files
- When formatting code with indentation, line breaks, and spacing
- When keeping functions small and focused on single responsibilities
- When removing dead code, commented-out blocks, or unused imports
- When extracting common logic into reusable functions or modules
- When avoiding code duplication (following DRY principle)
- When ensuring consistent naming conventions across the codebase
- When applying automated formatting tools (Prettier, ESLint, Black, gofmt)
- When using meaningful, descriptive names that reveal intent
- When deciding whether backward compatibility is needed
- When reviewing code for style consistency
- When refactoring large functions into smaller, testable pieces
- When establishing coding standards for new projects

This skill applies to all code files regardless of language or framework.

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global coding style.
