name: Backend Queries
description: Write efficient and secure database queries using parameterized statements, eager loading, and query optimization techniques to prevent SQL injection and N+1 query problems. Use this skill when writing database queries, ORM query methods, SQL statements, query builders, data fetching logic, or any code that retrieves or manipulates database data. This includes working with raw SQL, SQLAlchemy queries, Django QuerySets, Sequelize queries, TypeORM query builders, ActiveRecord scopes, Prisma queries, or similar database querying interfaces. Apply when implementing SELECT statements with specific columns, using JOINs or eager loading for related data, wrapping operations in transactions, adding WHERE clauses with parameterized values, implementing pagination, optimizing query performance, caching query results, or setting query timeouts.

# Backend Queries

## When to use this skill

- When writing database queries or ORM query methods
- When implementing data fetching logic in services or repositories
- When working with raw SQL statements or query builders
- When using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- When implementing eager loading or JOINs to avoid N+1 query problems
- When selecting specific columns instead of using SELECT *
- When wrapping related database operations in transactions
- When adding WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clauses to queries
- When implementing pagination or data filtering logic
- When optimizing slow queries or improving query performance
- When implementing query result caching strategies
- When setting query timeouts to prevent runaway queries
- When working with SQLAlchemy, Django QuerySets, Sequelize, TypeORM, ActiveRecord, Prisma, or similar query interfaces
- When refactoring queries for better performance or security

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend queries.
