name: Frontend CSS
description: Write and structure CSS using consistent methodology (Tailwind, BEM, CSS modules, utility classes), design tokens, and framework patterns while minimizing custom CSS and optimizing performance. Use this skill when writing or modifying CSS files, Tailwind utility classes, SCSS/SASS files, CSS modules, styled-components, CSS-in-JS, or any styling code. This includes working with stylesheets (.css, .scss, .sass, .less), inline styles, component styling, design system tokens (colors, spacing, typography), responsive breakpoints, CSS frameworks (Tailwind, Bootstrap, Material-UI), CSS methodologies (BEM, OOCSS, SMACSS), or CSS optimization. Apply when implementing layouts and visual designs, defining color palettes and typography scales, creating reusable style utilities, maintaining design tokens and CSS variables, avoiding framework style overrides, optimizing CSS bundle size with purging/tree-shaking, or ensuring consistent styling patterns across the project.
