name: Global Commenting
description: Write self-documenting code with clear structure and naming, using minimal helpful comments to explain complex logic without documenting recent changes or temporary fixes. Use this skill when writing or reviewing comments in any code file, documentation strings, inline comments, block comments, function/method documentation, or code explanations. This includes JSDoc comments, Python docstrings, JavaDoc, inline code comments, header comments, or any form of code documentation. Apply when deciding whether to add comments to code, writing comments that explain "why" rather than "what", keeping comments concise and minimal, avoiding change logs or fix notes in comments, preferring self-explanatory code over excessive commenting, documenting complex algorithms or business logic, or removing outdated or unnecessary comments. This skill applies universally to all programming languages and file types.
