name: Backend API
description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following REST principles with resource-based URLs, appropriate HTTP methods, and consistent naming conventions. Use this skill when creating or modifying API route handlers, endpoint definitions, REST controllers, API middleware, or any server-side code that defines HTTP endpoints. This includes working with Express routes, FastAPI endpoints, Django views, Rails controllers, or similar API frameworks. Apply when implementing CRUD operations, designing URL structures, handling HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), setting up API versioning, configuring query parameters for filtering/sorting/pagination, implementing rate limiting, or defining HTTP status code responses.
