name: Frontend Accessibility
description: Build accessible user interfaces using semantic HTML, proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, color contrast, and screen reader support following WCAG guidelines. Use this skill when creating or modifying UI components, HTML templates, JSX/TSX components, form elements, interactive widgets, navigation menus, modals, buttons, links, images, or any user-facing interface elements. This includes working with React components, Vue components, Angular templates, Svelte components, or plain HTML/JavaScript. Apply when implementing keyboard navigation and focus management, adding alt text to images, labeling form inputs, ensuring color contrast ratios, using semantic HTML elements (nav, main, button, header, footer), adding ARIA attributes for complex widgets, creating logical heading structures, managing focus in modals or dynamic content, or testing with screen readers.
