name: Global Tech Stack
description: Follow project-specific technology stack choices including frameworks, languages, package managers, frontend libraries, databases, ORMs, testing tools, and third-party services defined for the project. Use this skill when making technology choices, selecting libraries or frameworks, implementing features using project-standard tools, configuring build systems, setting up development environments, or ensuring consistency with the established tech stack. This includes working with the project's application framework (Rails, Django, Next.js, Express), frontend framework (React, Vue, Svelte), CSS framework (Tailwind, Bootstrap), database and ORM (PostgreSQL with Prisma, MySQL with Sequelize), testing framework (Jest, RSpec, pytest), or any other technology decisions. Apply when implementing new features using stack-appropriate patterns, avoiding introduction of non-standard technologies, configuring package managers and dependencies, setting up testing with project-standard tools, following framework-specific best practices, or maintaining consistency across the codebase. Reference the tech-stack.md file for project-specific technology decisions.

# Global Tech Stack

## When to use this skill

- When implementing new features or functionality in the project
- When making decisions about which libraries or frameworks to use
- When setting up new development environments or build configurations
- When configuring package managers (npm, yarn, pip, bundler)
- When choosing testing frameworks or testing approaches
- When selecting UI component libraries or CSS frameworks
- When implementing database queries or ORM operations
- When integrating third-party services (authentication, email, monitoring)
- When ensuring code follows framework-specific patterns and conventions
- When avoiding introduction of non-standard or conflicting technologies
- When reviewing code for tech stack consistency
- When updating or documenting technology choices
- When onboarding new team members to the project's technology decisions

Reference the project's tech-stack.md file for specific technology choices.

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global tech stack.
