name: Global Conventions
description: Follow project-wide development conventions including consistent project structure, clear documentation, version control best practices, environment configuration, dependency management, and testing requirements. Use this skill when organizing project files and directories, writing or updating README files, creating commit messages, managing pull requests, configuring environment variables, handling dependencies (package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod), implementing feature flags, maintaining changelogs, or establishing development workflows. Apply when structuring new projects or features, documenting setup instructions or architecture, writing meaningful commit messages, managing feature branches, securing API keys and secrets with environment variables, updating or documenting dependencies, defining code review processes, establishing testing requirements, or using feature flags for incomplete features. This skill applies to project-level organization and development practices across all languages and frameworks.
